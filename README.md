<img src = "https://github.com/jessica-medley/real-time-bus-tracker/blob/main/bustrackerscreenshot.png" width='300'/>

## Description: 
When you click 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard" you will see the bus icon move along the bus route where it stops. I updated the icon to a small bus. 

## How to Run: 
Simply copy the files into one folder on your computer, then open the html file in a browser. You could also drag the html file over to the browser. Once the page loads, click on the 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard' then the bus will move!

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
Expand to have multiple bus routes and a dropdown to select which bus route you want to see.

## License information: 
MIT license.
