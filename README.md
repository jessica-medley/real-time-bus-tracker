Title of the project: 
Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: 
When you click 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard" you will see the bus icon move along the bus route where it stops. I updated the icon to a small bus. 

How to Run: 
Simply copy the files into one folder on your computer, then open the html file in a browser. You could also drag the html file over to the browser. Once the page loads, click on the 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard' then the bus will move!

Roadmap of future improvements: 
Expand to have multiple buse routs and a dropdown to select which bus route you want to see.

License information: 
MIT license.
